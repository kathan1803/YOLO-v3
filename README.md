# YOLOv3 Pre-Trained Model Implementation

## Overview
This repository provides an implementation of the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) object detection model with pre-trained weights. YOLOv3 is known for its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection tasks.

## Features
Pre-trained YOLOv3 weights for detecting objects in images and videos.
Easy-to-use scripts for running inference.

## Required Python packages
TensorFlow 2.17.0
OpenCV 4.9.0.80
NumPy 1.26.4
Matplotlib 3.9.1

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/kathan1803/YOLO-v3.git

### 2. Download the pre-trained weights:
Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights file from here and place it in the weights directory
https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

## Results
The results will be saved in the images/result directory. For images, you'll get an annotated image with bounding boxes and labels.
