# <span style="color:blue;">YOLOv3 Pre-Trained Model Implementation</span>

## <span style="color:blue;">Overview</span>
This repository provides an implementation of the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) object detection model with pre-trained weights. YOLOv3 is known for its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection tasks.

## <span style="color:blue;">Features</span>
Pre-trained YOLOv3 weights for detecting objects in images and videos.

## <span style="color:blue;">Required Python packages</span>
- TensorFlow 2.17.0
- OpenCV 4.9.0.80
- NumPy 1.26.4
- Matplotlib 3.9.1

## <span style="color:blue;">Installation</span>

### <span style="color:blue;">1. Clone this repository:</span>
- git clone https://github.com/kathan1803/YOLO-v3.git

### <span style="color:blue;">2. Download the pre-trained weights:</span>
- Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights file from here and place it in the weights directory
- https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

## <span style="color:blue;">Results</span>
The results will be saved in the images/result directory. For images, you'll get an annotated image with bounding boxes and labels.
